<p>The most ridiculous rule I have ever heard of is a law in North Carolina that says that you cannot play bingo for more than 5 hours. I think this is stupid because I know many teenagers, adults, and elderly people that love to play bingo and are rather intense about the game. Besides, if an elderly person wants to play bingo obsessively, you let them play bingo obsessively.</p>

I feel like I've been typing forever oh my gosh. Seriously this is obsurd.</blockquote>
